# GestureGuru - Python Backend

This repository contains the backend components of the GestureGuru app. It includes the FastAPI server, pretrained machine learning models for sign language recognition, and inference APIs.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

GestureGuru aims to bridge the communication gap between deaf individuals and others by recognizing American Sign Language (ASL) signs and converting them to text using machine learning.

This backend:
- Hosts ML models for gesture recognition
- Serves inference APIs using FastAPI
- Processes real-time frames from the Flutter frontend

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack

- Python 3.9+
- FastAPI
- Uvicorn
- NumPy, OpenCV, TensorFlow / PyTorch
- Pretrained ASL Recognition Model
- CORS for cross-platform access
